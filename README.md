## Weather App!

## Description
You will be able to select a city, a temperature unit, and an active day from the carousel. After triggering any of these actions, the whole page will update its content to reflect the selection performed.
Things to keep in mind:
- I tried to achieve a decent test coverage, but I would have liked to do some more integration test had I had the time.
- If this were a "production" app, I would have thoroughly worked on the design. I did my best using the default styles.
